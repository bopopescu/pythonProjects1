As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key  itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side  encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced  Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data. <strong>Use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys  (SSE-KMS)</strong>  Similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits  along with some additional charges for using this service. There are separate  permissions for the use of an envelope key (that is, a key that protects your  data's encryption key) that provides added protection against unauthorized  access of your objects in S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail of  when your key was used and by whom. Additionally, you have the option to create  and manage encryption keys yourself, or use a default key that is unique to you,  the service you're using, and the region you're working in.  <strong>Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys  (SSE-C)</strong>  You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the  encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption, when you access your  objects. For more information on S3 encryption, please visit the link:<a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html"" target=""_blank"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html</a>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html",,,

Choose 2 correct answer from  the options below.,multi-select, Integrating a range  of programs and components, Automate workflows  that include human tasks, Load balancing  between applications, Routing between  applications,,,,"Answer  A and BAmazon SWF can be used to address many challenges that arise while building  applications with distributed components. For example, you can use Amazon SWF  and the accompanying AWS Flow Framework for:Writing your applications as asynchronous programs using simple    programming constructs that abstract details such as initiating tasks to run    remotely and tracking the program’s runtime state.Maintaining your application’s execution state (e.g. which steps have    completed, which ones are running, etc.). You do not have to use databases,    custom systems, or ad hoc solutions to keep execution state.Communicating and managing the flow of work between your application    components. With Amazon SWF, you do not need to design a messaging protocol or    worry about lost and duplicated tasks.Centralizing the coordination of steps in your application. Your    coordination logic does not have to be scattered across different components,    but can be encapsulated in a single program.Integrating a range of programs and components, including legacy systems    and 3rd party cloud services, into your applications. By allowing your    application flexibility in where and in what combination the application    components are deployed, Amazon SWF helps you gradually migrate application    components from private data centers to public cloud infrastructure without    disrupting the application availability or performance.Automating workflows that include long-running human tasks (e.g.    approvals, reviews, investigations, etc.) Amazon SWF reliably tracks the    status of processing steps that run up to several days or months.For more information on SWF , please visit the link:<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/"" target=""_blank"">https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/</a>https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/",,,

Company B has a DynamoDB table where the average item size is 20KB. Company B  anticipates the application will read 10 items from the table per second using  eventually consistent reads. How much read capacity throughput should they  provision? Choose the correct answer from the options below.,multiple-choice,50,100,25,20,,,,"Answer  -  CFor read capacity, the rule is to divide the item size by 4KB. Hence we need  to divide 20 by 4 which gives us 5 to the nearest 4KB. Since we are writing 10  items per second, we need to multiply 10*5 =50. Since it is eventual  consistency, we need to divide by 2 which gives us 25.For more information on working with tables in dynamoDB , please visit the  link:<a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html"" target=""_blank"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html</a>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html",,,
