"Company B is using strongly consistent reads to request 50 items per second from their customer table. Each item is 20kb in size
What throughout would be required to efficiently handle the read throughput of the table?",multiple-choice,150,50,250,125,,,3,"
For read capacity, the rule is to divide the item size by 4KB. Hence we need to divide 20 by 4 which gives us 5 to the nearest 4KB. Since we are writing 50 items per second, we need to multiply 50*5 = 250.

",multiple-choice,200,300,150,100,,,3,"For read capacity, the rule is to divide the item size by 4KB. Hence we need to divide 10 by 4 which gives us 3 to the nearest 4KB.
