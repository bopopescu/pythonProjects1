e6.JPGQ: When should I use Amazon DynamoDB vs Amazon S3?
Amazon DynamoDB stores structured data, indexed by primary key, and allows low latency read and write access to items ranging from
1 byte up to 400KB. Amazon S3 stores unstructured blobs and suited for storing large objects up to 5 TB. In order to optimize your costs
across AWS services, large objects or infrequently accessed data sets should be stored in Amazon S3, while smaller data elements or file
pointers (possibly to Amazon S3 objects) are best saved in Amazon DynamoDB
