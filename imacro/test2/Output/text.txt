You have created an Elastic Load Balancer with Duration-Based sticky sessions enabled in front of your six EC2 web
application instances in US-West-2. For High Availability, there are three web application instances in Availability Zone 1
and three web application instances in Availability Zone 2. To load test, you set up a software-based load tester in
Availability Zone 2 to send traffic to the Elastic Load Balancer, as well as letting several hundred users browse to the
ELB's hostname. After a while, you notice that the users' sessions are spread evenly across the EC2 instances in both
AZ's, but the software-based load tester's traffic is hitting only the instances in Availability Zone 2. What steps can you
take to resolve this problem? Choose the 2 correct answer from the options below
Please select
A. Create a software-based load tester in US-East-1 and test from there
B. Force the software-based load tester to re-resolve DNS before every request
C. Use a third party load-testing service to send requests from globally distributed clients
D. Switch to Application-Controlled sticky sessions

You receive a call from a potential client who explains that one of the many services they offer is a website running on a
t2.micro EC2 instance where users can submit requests for customized e-cards to be sent to their friends and family. The
e-card website administrator was on a cruise and was shocked when he returned to the office in mid-January to find
hundreds of angry emails complaining that customers' loved ones had not received their Christmas cards. He also had
several emails from CloudWatch alerting him that the SOS queue for the e-card application had grown to over 500
messages on December 25th. You investigate and find that the problem was caused by a crashed EC2 instance which
serves as an application server. What do you advise your client to do first? Choose the correct answer from the options
below
Please select
O A. Use an autoscaling group to create as many application servers as needed to process all of the Christmas card SQS
messages
O B. Reboot the application server immediately so that it begins processing the Christmas card SOS messages
O C. Redeploy the application server as a larger instance type so that it can process the Christmas card SOS messages
faster
D. Send an apology to the customers notifying them that their cards will not be delivered

topic. What are appropriate ways for you to provide timely, device-specific instructions to end users when announcing this
downtime? Choose an answer from the options below
Please select:

You created three S3 buckets - "mydomain.com", "downloads.mydomain.com", and "www.mydomain.com". You
uploaded your files, enabled static website hosting, specified both of the default documents under the "enable static website
hosting" header, and set the "Make Public" permission for the objects in each of the three buckets. All that's left for you to
do is to create the Route 53 Aliases for the three buckets
You are going to have your end users test your websites by browsing to http://mydomain.com/error.html
http://downloads.mydomain.com/index.html, and
http://www.mydomain.com
What problems will your testers encounter? Choose an answer from the options below
Please select
A·http://mydomain.com/error.html will not work because you did not set a value for the error.html file
o B. http://www.mydomain.com will not work because the URL does not include a file name at the end of it.
C. There will be no problems, all three sites should work.
O D. http://downloads.mydomain.com/index.html will not work because the "downloads" prefix is not a supported prefix
for S3 websites using Route 53 aliases

As you retrieve information from DynamoDB, you receive this error: "ProvisionedThroughputExceededException", but
upon investigation you notice that you're not exceeding your table read capacity throughput. What is causing this error?
Choose the correct answer from the options below
Please select
O A. DynamoDB needs a short amount of time to pre-warm before being able to handle a spike in demand, even if a table
has enough throughput capacity configured
O B. Metrics reported by AWS are not always real-time and could take a minute or so to appear
C. This happens when using sort keys because they consume an extra read capacity for each call which doubles
throughput
D. We are exceeding a partition's throughput capacity, even if we're not exceeding the table throughput capacity
